Messages have the form:
message := system object action parameterList
parameterList := parameter +
parameter := parameterKey = parameterValue

system, object, action, parameterKey are marked with interfaces to encourage reusing defined constants (typically in enums that implement the marker interface).
This also makes it possible to use autocompletion on these values and to assist in postprocessing (e.g., since we can easily iterate over enum values).

Dynamic strings can still be constructed but must implementing the marker interface.
