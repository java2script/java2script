/*
 * ClassLoader Summary
 * 
 * ClassLoader creates SCRIPT elements and setup class path and onload 
 * callback to continue class loading.
 *
 * In the onload callbacks, _Loader will try to calculate the next-to-be-
 * load *.js and load it. In *.js, it will contains some codes like
 * Clazz.load (..., "$wt.widgets.Control", ...);
 * to provide information to build up the class dependency tree.
 *
 * Some known problems of different browsers:
 * 1. In IE, loading *.js through SCRIPT will first triggers onreadstatechange 
 * event, and then executes inner *.js source.
 * 2. In Firefox, loading *.js will first executes *.js source and then 
 * triggers onload event.
 * 3. In Opera, similar to IE, but trigger onload event. (TODO: More details 
 * should be studied. Currently, Opera supports no multiple-thread-loading)
 * 
 * For class dependency tree, actually, it is not a tree. It is a reference
 * net with nodes have n parents and n children. There is a root, which 
 * ClassLoader knows where to start searching and loading classes, for such
 * a net. Each node is a class. Each class may require a set of must-classes, 
 * which must be loaded before itself getting initialized, and also need a set
 * of optional classes, which also be loaded before being called.
 *
 * The class loading status will be in 6 stages.
 * 1. Unknown, the class is newly introduced by other class.
 * 2. Known, the class is already mentioned by other class.
 * 3. Loaded, *.js source is in memory, but may not be initialized yet. It 
 * requires all its must-classes be intiailized, which is in the next stage.
 * 4. Musts loaded, all must classes is already loaded and declared.
 * 5. Delcared, the class is already declared (_Loader#isClassDefined).
 * 6. Optionals loaded, all optional classes is loaded and declared.
 *
 * The ClassLoader tries to load all necessary classes in order, and intialize
 * them in order. For such job, it will traverse the dependency tree, and try 
 * to next class to-be-loaded. Sometime, the class dependencies may be in one
 * or more cycles, which must be broken down so classes is loaded in correct
 * order.
 *
 * Loading order and intializing order is very important for the ClassLoader.
 * The following technical options are considered:
 * 1. SCRIPT is loading asynchronously, which means controling order must use
 * callback methods to continue.
 * 2. Multiple loading threads are later introduced, which requires the 
 * ClassLoader should use variables to record the class status.
 * 3. Different browsers have different loading orders, which means extra tests
 * should be tested to make sure loading order won't be broken.
 * 4. Java2Script simulator itself have some loading orders that must be 
 * honored, which means it should be integrated seamlessly to Clazz system.
 * 5. Packed *.z.js is introduced to avoid lots of small *.js which requires 
 * lots of HTTP connections, which means that packed *.z.js should be treated
 * specially (There will be mappings for such packed classes).
 * 6. *.js or *.css loading may fail according to network status, which means
 * another loading try should be performed, so _Loader is more robust.
 * 7. SWT lazy loading is later introduced, which means that class loading
 * process may be paused and should be resumed later.
 *
 * Some known bugs:
 * <code>$_L(["$wt.graphics.Drawable","$wt.widgets.Widget"],
 *  "$wt.widgets.Control", ...</code>
 * has errors while must classes in different order such as
 * <code>$_L(["$wt.widgets.Widget", "$wt.graphics.Drawable"],
 *  "$wt.widgets.Control", ...</code>
 * has no error.
 * 
 * Other maybe bug scenarios:
 * 1. In <code>_Loader.maxLoadingThreads = 1;</code> single loading thread 
 * mode, there are no errors, but in default multiple thread loading mode, 
 * there are errors.
 * 2. No errors in one browser, but has errors on other browsers (Browser 
 * script loading order differences).
 * 3. First time loading has errors, but reloading it gets no errors (Maybe 
 * HTTP connections timeout, but should not accur in local file system, or it
 * is a loading bug by using JavaScript timeout thread).
